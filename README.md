Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for number is divisible of three print `is divisible to 3` instead of the number and for the number is divisible of five print `is divisible to 5`. 
For numbers which are divisible of both three and five print `is divisible to 3 and 5`. Remember, you can use the modulus operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. <br>
**output should like this below**
```
1
2
3 is divisible to 3
4
5 is divisible to 5
6 is divisible to 3
... up to 100
